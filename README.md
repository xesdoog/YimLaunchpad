# YLP (formerly YimLaunchpad)

**Version 2.0** marks a complete rewrite of the platform from Python to C++, built for performance, stability, and a seamless user experience.

This new version focuses primarily on performance but also brings a more user-friendly UI, built-in updater, and an overall
more refined workflow.

## 🚀 What's New

- Fully native **C++ implementation**.
- Integrated **auto-update system**.
- Lightweight **ImGui-based interface**.
- Improved **logging**, **error handling**, and **performance**.
- Simplified **project structure** and **mod management**.
- A full-fledged **process monitor** for both **GTA V** and **GTA V Enhanced** *(with the ability to choose which one to monitor)*.
- Optional support for **YimMenu V2**.
- A standalone injector + custom DLLs.
- An improved Lua manager.
- All features from **YLP Python** refined and ported to **C++**.

>[Note]
> Windows will flag the executable on first launch. You'll have to whitelist it in your anti-virus.
> I neither have the money nor the reputation for Microsoft to trust my code. You'll have to read the source and decide for yourself.
