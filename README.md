###  

> [!NOTE]
> **Work In Progress**. Uploaded for testing purposes.
> 
> General stuff like downloading and keeping YimMenu up-to-date, launching the game, injecting the dll, downloading Lua scripts all work.
>
> Further improvements will be implemented.

###  

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid spamming the Lua Scripts tab *(refreshing the list multiple times, closing and relaunching the app, etc...)*. The GitHub API has a rate limit for unauthenticated requests and will put you on a timeout if you exceed that limit.
